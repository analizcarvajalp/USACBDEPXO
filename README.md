# USACBDEPXO


USACBD EXPO AWARDS Page

Bootstrap, jquery and slick were used to style the page.

The page has phone view, tablet view, and desktop view, as well as landscape view for phone.

For the smaller screens, the categories part remained like a carousel so as not to have to shrink the images and lose the aesthetics.

In the tablet view a simple menu was created, different from the desktop view.

Enjoy :).
